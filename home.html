        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

        Established in May 1999 by famous spiritual and religious scholar Maulana Bashir Ahmed Farooqui, Saylani Welfare
        International Trust was built on the fundamentals of breaking the cycle of poverty, alleviating the financial
        troubles of the poor, giving people a chance to live a dignified life and spreading happiness.

        We are an organization that believes in lighting up the lives of underprivileged people across the world. We
        endeavor to provide the best quality services in areas including food, education, medical and social welfare
        free of cost to people living in the dark. With over 60 different sectors, we feed thousands of hungry people
        each day, hundreds more are given the hope of life through medical health care, many are educated to become
        leaders of tomorrow and several are given the opportunity to stand on their feet financially.

        Today, we are proud to say that our physical presence extends throughout Pakistan with a vast network of 125
        branches operating in major cities including Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad and Faisalabad.
        Apart from Pakistan, we have overseas offices in the UK, USA and UAE as well. Our worldwide branches are
        operating under the guidance of a team of over 2,000 working professionals who help almost 125,000 people on a
